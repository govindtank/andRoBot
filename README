This project uses Android, along with cloud based APIs and the 80c51 microcontroller, to create a software-hardware system that attempts to address several current problems in robotics, including, among other things, line-following, obstacle-avoidance, voice control, voice synthesis, remote surveillance, motion & obstacle detection, face detection and remote live image streaming. The rover, built upon a portable five-layered architecture, will use several mature and a few experimental algorithms in Web and Mobile Development, Computer Vision and Robotics behind-the-scene to provide its prospective user in defense, entertainment or industrial sector a positive user experience. A minimal amount of security is achieved using MD5, SHA1 and AES.
